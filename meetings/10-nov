Look into how AB works - open vs closed loop request systems
	keep alive param
	sort flask logic, can be simpler and just vary CPU util through c param in ab

Does Docker Swarm load balance in L4 / L7 (req vs connection)?

Look into tracing the requests - Jaeger?

Possibly look into Traefik (lb problem solved by reverse-proxy, and really nice with Jaeger)



Need to read papers - keep up to date with the SotA and make a case for push based
