Look into how AB works - open vs closed loop request systems
	keep alive param
	sort flask logic, can be simpler and just vary CPU util through c param in ab

Does Docker Swarm load balance in L4 / L7 (req vs connection)?

Look into tracing the requests - Jaeger?

Possibly look into Traefik (lb problem solved by reverse-proxy, and really nice with Jaeger)



Need to read papers - keep up to date with the SotA and make a case for push based

Seems like swarm doesn't support ipv6, so using localhost on openSUSE isn't enough:
	wget localhost:16686 doesn't work
	wget -4 localhost:16686 does
	
	use 127.0.0.1 explicitly


Just realised - both my machines have different CPUs, so CPU from docker stats isn't an effective measure. VMs it is!

TODO: 

Traefik - A reverse proxy would probably make sense at some point, better sooner rather than later

Prometheus (+ Grafana) - Jaeger isn't too useful tbh, it's not meant for aggregation. Prom might be better.
