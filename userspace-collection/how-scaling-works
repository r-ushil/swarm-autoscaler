HTTP request sent to manager node's daemon (either local or via tcp) - this is via /var/run/docker.sock, or port 2375

needs to have things like versioning for concurrency control, gets validated / applied
then passed to Docker's orchestration layer - which compares desired state with current state and makes adjustments.
then schedules to choose suitable node in cluster for add/remove, then deploys/rolls out.


why not construct the HTTP request ourselves?
	because they recommend not to - there seems to be a very specific way to interface with this docker daemon they abstract away
	looks like the way the api works - the entire current state needs to be fetched, updated and passed back in (ugh)
