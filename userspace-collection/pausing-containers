docker pause / unpause look like they just change the cgroup.freeze file


we need a way to
	- pause when we want to scale down and our number of replicas is 1
	- stop monitoring this container now (remove from channel)
	- spawn goroutine to watch out for network requests to the stopped container
		- can be ebpf
		- store network requests in a queue
			- start container up again (spawn monitoring goroutine)
		- ordering here matters - unpause, then empty out ebpf map into container, then stop ebpf, then start monitoring again - this way no concurrency issue
